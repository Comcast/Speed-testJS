# SpeedtestJS
Speed-testJS is a JavaScript based speed test that will provide users 
with an enriched view of their Internet speed. Providing users with not 
only their latency, upload and download speeds and context around their 
entire Internet experience. Using speed tier data to add a qualifying 
metric to standard speed test results users will now know whether their 
experience is poor, good or great

## Deployment
For deploying to a test server, see the README under **ansible** folder.
